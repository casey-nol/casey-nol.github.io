**Project description:** For my undergraduate dissertation, I designed and developed an interactive visualisation dashboard using React and D3.js. The dashboard is aimed at facilitating the management of urban water resources in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia. This project involved working with data collected by the Water4Cities project, encompassing rainfall and groundwater level readings from sensors and monitoring equipment across the region as well as geospatial data about the region stored as shapefiles . My responsibilities included creating various visualisations, including an interactive choropleth map, enabling users and stakeholders to explore data at regional and municipal levels.
