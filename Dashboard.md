## Water4Cities Visualization Dashboard for Water Resource Management


<img src="images/dashboard_vid.gif?raw=true"/>

**Project description:** For my undergraduate dissertation, I designed and developed an interactive visualisation dashboard aimed at facilitating the management of urban water resources in Ljubljana, Slovenia. This project involved working with data collected by the Water4Cities project, encompassing rainfall and groundwater level readings from sensors and monitoring equipment across the region as well as geospatial data about the region stored as shapefiles . My responsibilities included creating various visualisations, including an interactive choropleth map, enabling users and stakeholders to explore data at regional and municipal levels. â€¨
